    <h4>Commute - Application for Android</h4>
    <p> I was invited to work on a project called Commute. It is still in the early development stage, but we aim to deliver an application to help with our customersâ€™ daily work commutes. The app records your travel time to and from work every day. It then calculates mean, fastest, and slowest travel times. It then projects weekly, monthly, and annual travel times. With this information the user can more regularly monitor their commute to and from work, saving time. Starting this project will help me to develop my coding, teamwork, and business skills when working on this project.

    <h4>Java Game</h4>
    <p> As a small university project I worked in a team with three others to make a simple Java game. As well as my part in coding the project I drew the sprites by hand, then digitised and animatied them.
